Hi, I’m @Ohyoucow or "G"
I'm interested in all aspects of technology especially those focused on errors and debugging.
I enjoy trying to understand where machines get confused and like trying out multiple ideas to fix the confusion.
I’m currently expanding my knowledge in JS/HTML/Network Operations. I have expereince with Python/Java/Android Studio/Visual Studio and a few other languages and IDE's.
I’m looking to collaborate on any and all projects so long as they're interesting, challengeing, and worthwhile.

*Feel free to message me or comment on anything related to my account, projects, contributions and I will respond.*

Fun fact: The very first programming language I learned was Java because I enjoyed playing RuneScape growing up.
